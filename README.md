# Web_Scrape_From_Wikipedia_Using_Pandas
## 1: Install the necessary libraries such as Pandas, requests, and BeautifulSoup. You can do this by running the following command in your command prompt or terminal.
## 2: Import the Pandas library by adding the following line of code at the beginning of your Python script.
## 3: Read the HTML content of the website you want to scrape using the pd.read_html() function.
## 4: The read_html() function returns a list of DataFrames, so you can use the [] notation to access the specific DataFrame you want to work with.
## 5: Use the Pandas dataframe to view the scraped data, export it to a CSV file, or use it in further data analysis.


### Note: Make sure to read and abide by the website's terms of service and guidelines for web scraping before proceeding. Also, it is important to mention that, pd.read_html() function can only scrape data from tables and not from other HTML elements.
